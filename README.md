This project was created as a take-home assignment for AggieWorks' Winter 2023 Recruiting.\
The project uses [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) in order to obtain data about the user's chosen Pokemon.\
To run the project, run:
### `npm start`
and the project will launch on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)\
Thanks to AggieWorks for this chance to apply and create such a fun project!
